# 🤖 Chatbots

Welcome to the **Chatbots** repository! This project is a collection of intelligent conversational agents built using modern NLP techniques, including rule-based, retrieval-based, and generative approaches.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository showcases various chatbot implementations ranging from basic rule-based bots to advanced LLM-powered assistants. It’s designed to help developers and learners understand the inner workings of conversational AI, and to experiment with different architectures and deployment techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ **Rule-based bots** using pattern matching
- 🔍 **Retrieval-based chatbots** with vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS)
- 💬 **Generative chatbots** powered by transformer models (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
- 🌐 Web-based UI using Streamlit or Flask
- 📦 Modular and scalable architecture
- 🔧 Easy integration with APIs and custom datasets
